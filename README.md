# Afterthoughts for Leetcode contests
It's such a waste to let the nervousness, the pain, and the thriving just disappear after 1.5 hours.

As of September 5th, 2020, leetcode contests usually have 4 problems with points between 3 to 8 (rarely seen).

## Format
For each contest there will be a markdown file named the same as contest id.

File format would be:
```
# [Question 1](Link)

## Thought Process

### First Impression

### Run Local Tests (if spotted bugs while running local tests)

### Final Codepath

## Code
    ```
        Code block
    ```

## Result

## Correct Solution (one of perhaps many, if unable to solve in contest)

## Optimizations (if seen better solutions after the contest)

// then question 2,3,4...
